    *"In music, an ostinato (derived from Italian: "stubborn", compare English:

Introduction
============

Django-ostinato is a collection of applications that aims to bring together
some of the most common features expected from a CMS.

Every feature is contained within a single ostinato app. This helps us to keep
functionality focussed on the single feature/task that the app is meant to
provide
