Welcome to django-ostinato's documentation!
===========================================

    *"In music, an ostinato (derived from Italian: "stubborn", compare English:
    obstinate) is a motif or phrase, which is persistently repeated in the same
    musical voice."*

    -- `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostinato>`_


Introduction
============

Django-ostinato is a collection of applications that aims to bring together
some of the most common features expected from a CMS.

Every feature is contained within a single ostinato app. This helps us to keep
functionality focussed on the single feature/task that the app is meant to
provide
