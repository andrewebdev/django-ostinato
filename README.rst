Introduction
============

Django-ostinato is a collection of applications that aims to bring together
some of the most common features expected from a CMS. We try to do things in a
way that gives the developer as much freedom and power as possible for future
upgrades/updates, by not modifying the admin too much with external
dependencies.

Please feel free to log any issues on the `Github issue tracker <https://github.com/andrewebdev/django-ostinato/issues>`_.

For more detailed information `read the documentation <http://django-ostinato.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_.
